# SARK100 Firmware Investigations

Investigating mods to the SARK100 firmware.

I mainly use my SARK100 to do frequency scans with the PC, and I've been looking at the calibration process and how it affects the data.

After working on understanding how the bridge voltages are used to calculate |Z|, Re(Z) and Im(Z) (and VSWR), which I intend to write up here, I've worked out how to [update the firmware from source code](https://g1ojs.github.io/SARK100-Firmware/Editing%20SARK100%20Firmware%20in%202024) which wasn't easy given the uC chip is decades old now.

More coming soon!
