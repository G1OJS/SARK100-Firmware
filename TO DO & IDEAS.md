TO DO
   - Thorough cal test
   - L & C measurement tests (frequency scan and display) - can we detect & warn if we are near resonance?
   - Something on applicability limits for cable measurements
   - generalise PrintWdToSerial & refactor - this can be used in freq to LCD as well as pclink
   

IDEAS - firmware
  - Refactor scan routines
  - User choice of cal loads
  - User choice of cal frequencies
  - True ham band limits as well as HF dividers
  - User choice of VSWR threshold
  - Investigate cal which includes reactive loads - does it help?
  - Make use of sine fitting to Va and Vz for cable measurement? Can we measure cable loss?
