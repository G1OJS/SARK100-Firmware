TO DO
   - Add a guide page for L and C measurement
   - Dizzling during PClink scan
   - Look at dynamic range of Vz/Va error correction (high impedances >~1000R)
   - Something on applicability limits for cable measurements   

IDEAS - firmware
  - User choice of cal loads
  - User choice of cal frequencies
  - True ham band limits as well as HF dividers
  - User choice of VSWR threshold
  - Investigate cal which includes reactive loads - does it help?
  - Make use of sine fitting to Va and Vz for cable measurement? Can we measure cable loss?
