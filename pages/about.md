This site hosts the G1OJS firmware for the SARK100 Antenna Analyser (and its clones). 

I developed this update to EA4FRb's V13 SARK100 source code for my own education and to see if I could improve the calibration procedures and add more features, and I've published it in the hope that it will be useful.

Note that my antenna analyser, which I used to develop and test this firmware, is an "MR300" unit produced by [LXQQFY.com](http://www.lxqqfy.com/e/product.php?id=MR300). I believe that the firmware should work on the SARK100 as well as on MR100 and other variants of the SARK100 analyser, but I have no way of testing on these other devices.
