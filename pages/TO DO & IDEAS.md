TO DO
   - finish completing new-look pages
   - Test checklist (all done but write up!)
   - Thorough cal test
   - L & C measurement tests (frequency scan and display) - can we detect & warn if we are near resonance?
   - Something on applicability limits for cable measurements

IDEAS - theory
  - Maths for Va and Vz when connected to open/short line (done - what next?)
  - could use result to create a match pattern for fitting results rather than relying on detecting minima
  - Investigate cal which includes reactive loads

IDEAS - firmware
  - User choice of cal loads
  - User choice of cal frequencies
  - True ham band limits as well as HF dividers
