# Introduction
  
Much of the online material about Wheatstone bridges focusses on the case where the bridge is balanced, or nearly balanced ($\vert Z_l\vert$ ~ 50 ohms in this case). 
In an instrument that uses a bridge with fixed reference resistors to measure unknown impedance values, we need to work out the unknown impedance from measurements on an unbalanced bridge. The diagram below shows a generic case of such a bridge. 

When using detectors that respond to amplitude only, there are *three* independent voltages that can be measured, shown as $V_r$ , $V_z$  and $V_a$ . 
These three voltages are all *dependent* on $V_f$ (or $2V_f$, the generator voltage, if that's easier to visualise). 
$V_z$ and $V_a$ are independent from each other because, whilst in vector terms $2V_f = V_z + V_a$, the 
magnitude of these quantities does not follow this rule if $Z_l$ is not a pure resistance.

**From here onwards, assume that all voltages are scalar quantities (i.e. refer to the magnitude of the complex voltage) unless stated otherwise.**

# Bridge Voltage Magnitudes
<details>
  <summary>Explanation</summary>
  
  We can calculate the expected magnitude of these voltages as follows.
  
  <p>$V_a$ and $V_z$ are voltages across the two impedances of a simple potential divider, albeit with one of the impedances potentially complex.</p>
  
  <p>If, for example, $2V_f$ is 1.0, the magnitude of the current flowing through the load and upper resistor 
  will be $\frac{1}{\vert Z_l+50\vert }$ </p>

  <p>Multiplying this by 50 for the upper resistor and 
  and  $\vert Z_l\vert $ for the unknown load gives the magnitude of the voltages 
  relative to $2V_f$. Hence, </p>
  <div class='equation'>
    <table style='border:none;'><tr><td style='border:none;'>$$V_a=2V_f\frac{50}{\vert Z_l+50\vert }$$</td></tr></table>
  </div>
  <div class='equation'>
    <table style='border:none;'><tr><td style='border:none;'>$$V_z=2V_f\frac{\vert Z_l\vert }{\vert Z_l+50\vert }$$</td></tr></table>
  </div>
  <div  style='clear:both'></div>

  <p>To get at $V_r$ we simply note that in *vector* terms, $V_r = V_f - V_z$ , and the magnitude $V_r$ is then $\vert V_f - V_z\vert $ .</p>

  <p>On the left of the bridge we have $V_f$, and on the right we use potential divider maths again to get the midpoint voltage. 
  Then, with complex-valued calculations inside the $\vert mod\vert $ bars, we have</p>

  <div class='equation'>
    <table style='border:none;'><tr><td style='border:none;'>$$V_r = \vert  2V_f \frac{Z_l}{Z_l+50} - V_f\vert $$</td></tr></table>
  </div>
  <div  style='clear:both'></div>

  <p>so our three equations are:</p>
