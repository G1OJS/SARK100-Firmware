# “Scan”
Scans the current band for minimum VSWR. If a minimum below 2:1 is found, the lower and upper frequencies where the VSWR rises above 2:1 are displayed below the SWR and best match frequency.
# Press “UP”
- Increase frequency, Increase frequency step, escape/back depending on context
- Long press / hold down = increase frequency quickly without measuring
# Press “Down”
- Decrease frequency, Decrease frequency step, or confirm depending on context
- Long press / hold down = decrease frequency quickly without measuring
# Press “UP” and “DOWN” together
- Enter & exit setting the freqyency increment digit
- Once in  increment digit setting mode you can also press Config once to get back to the normal mode
