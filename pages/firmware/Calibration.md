The methodology for correcting measurement errors by using calibration data is described here: [Correcting measurement errors with calibration data](https://g1ojs.github.io/G1OJS-MR300-SARK100-Firmware/CorrectingMeasurementErrors/). This page covers both the techniques used in EA4FRB's V13, and my V1.0.
