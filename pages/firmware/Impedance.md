After the welcome screen and 'Uncalibrated!' warning, the first screen you will see after turn-on is the main impedance screen shown here. All of the impedance and SWR information that was spread across a couple of screens in the previous version is in this one screen (having said that, you won't find band titles such as 40m anywhere - something had to go!). The instrument makes a new measurement every two seconds and always works out the sign of the reactance, if possible, by measuring at the displayed frequency and another offset from it.

The second picture here illustrates what happens if values are out of measurement range, or more precisely, out of display range. No artificial constraints are placed on the measured values.
