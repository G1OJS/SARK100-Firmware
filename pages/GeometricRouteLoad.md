# Introduction
Calculating the complex load impedance from $\vert Z_L \vert$ and $\vert \Gamma \vert$ requires quite a bit of algebraic manipulation if done from scratch. The accademic level required is roughly that at which people learn about quadratic equations, but it is easy to drop a minus sign or lose track of the route to the solution. This page presents a graphical / geometric approach, which might be easier to follow.

# The Geometry

Firstly, we set up the problem by plotting an unknown load impedance $Z_L$ on the complex impedance plane, see diagram below. We can easily add a circle that captures all impedance values that have the same magnitude $\vert Z \vert$ as our unknown load. This circlue crosses the real (resistance) axis where $R = \vert Z_L \vert$, although we don't need to remember this value for the steps that follow.
