Calculation changes
  1. Capacitance and inductance calculations now work above 10MHz and show measured resistance alongside capacitance / inductance
  2. Internal software structural change - calibration frequencies separated from band frequencies, giving greater freedom for setting cal frequencies and band edges at design time
  3. Calibration data is linearly interpolated between adjacent calibration frequencies, giving improved accuracy & smoother results across frequency
  4. Added Va and Vz zero calibration with open and short calibration load, and subtraction from measurement before correction factors applied. This gives better accuracy near short and open conditions.
  5. Added two-step piecewise linear calibration for Va for high Z loads - better accuracy for high Z loads
  6. Calibration now done at selected frequencies to avoid spurii
  7. Available DDS gain settings table modified to provide finer steps for DDS gain setting during calibration
  8. DDS gain maintained at lowest frequency setting to avoid steps in output caused when gain changes
  9. Code refactored to reduce memory usage & potentially allow more functions to be added
  10. Fixed display errors caused by SWR being lower than implied by |Z| 
  11. Added 0.1 ohm display resolution for values of R,X,Z below 10 (also added to pcLink output). Display now 1dp for all quantities, pcLink has 2dp but only SWR has 2dp precision.
  

UI changes
  1. G1OJS Callsign in welcome screen
  2. Added 60m band
  3. Default mode is now "IMP" not "SWR" (also see 9 and note below)
  4. Removed delay following change of band
  5. Added R display to L and C measurements
  6. Changed "OFF" to "SIG"
  7. Changed "suspend timeout" to "Set Idle Timeout"
  8. Default idle timeout set to off
  9. Redesigned the main display - everything on previous SWR and IMP displays combined.
	- Fixed hopping numbers on dizzling and made display less confusing by removing ">10" at start of line under "IMP"
 10. Added "scanrp" command to output both uncorrected and corrected bridge voltages
 11. Added frequency readout / progress indicator to calibration routine
 12. Added automatic restart after calibration
 13. Added a beep when band changes from 6m back to 160m
 14. Default increment for key up / down = 100kHz (was 10kHz)
 15. Added DDS Settings menu to select 1) DDS Gain Levelling ON/OFF 2) DIZZLING ON/OFF
 16. Scan for match now sets step size internally -> faster and no need for config menu for step size

NOTE - the main display now combines SWR, |Z|, R and X into one view. As in V13, "dizzling" is used to determine the sign of the reactance. Whilst dizzling is active, the unit can't be used as a VFO for other experiments (because the frequency toggles constantly up and down). However, pressing the mode key moves the unit into a non-dizzling mode equivalent to the previous "SWR" mode, but with all elements of the display retained. Instead of changing the display, a simple "#" is placed where the sign of the reactance would normally show. 

Source code tidying
1. Made variable names and function names more descriptive (e.g. including reference to units - e.g. Hz - in variable names)

Ideas for next version
- Check if changing Vz cal to 50-274 instead of current 50-150 gives better overall results. 
   (Current scheme is Vr 150-274, Vz 50-150, Va1 50-150, Va2 150-274 Could also try Va2 150-1000 or 274-1000, or a value like 470R instead of 1000R)
- Consider adding a correction factor for Vr / VSWR - it's sometimes too low & affects R calculation
- Look closer at limits of applicability of L and C calculations.
- Improve LCD display on pcLink
- Look at band limits. What if we make them not contiguous? Better? Worse? Good for scanning (faster)?
- Argument for setmeasurecalcdisplay - use descriptive #defs rather than literals
- Investigate adding a variable-output VFO mode.


## Calculation / function changes
1. Fixed power meter arithmetic error affecting dBm readings above ~0dBm
2. DDS is now off in all situations except briefly around measurements and for VFO mode
3. Main warning beeps replaced by morse code: U = uncalibrated, Err = error, SK = done
4. Speeded up non-blocking (& not too important) text messages
5. DDS Gain setting table recalculated to give 10~15dB range in DDS output level setting
6. Revised calibration storage to fit in more calibration points across frequency

## UI changes
1. Added VFO mode with power level control (press Config key once in VFO mode and then use up/down keys)
2. Added config setting for CW notification / beep pitch

## Code structure changes
1. Refactoring to push low level calls out of higher level blocks
2. Revision of function names to be more descriptive
3. Revision of comments
4. Review and revision of #include statements
5. Developped sleep timer to handle all timing functions making Delay Timer redundant (& this module removed)
6. 16 bit bridge ratios stored for calibration encoded into 8 bits for storage, doubling the max number of entries possible

## Ideas for next version
Display a brief message "Dizzling off"/"Dizzling on" when changing between the first two modes.
(Is the 'no dizzling' mode needed now there is a VFO mode?)
Dynamic DDS level control via finer control voltage?
Replace 1/4 step msg with msg showing new step
Add calibration routine for power level meter
Auto frequency sweep to find max and min impedance (or simply Vf) to measure cable lengths
Extra VFO functions - two tone generator? CW beacon? Sweep gen for filter measurements with SDR?
See if adding back DDS output levelling works better with new cal scheme
