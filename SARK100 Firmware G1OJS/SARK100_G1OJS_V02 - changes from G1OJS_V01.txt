## Calculation changes
 1. New calibration routine with standard resistors (E12+50ohms): 10,50,220,560
	- Removed G1OJS_V01 routine which was based on EA4FRB_V13
	- Replaced with new routine which applies simple correction factors to the ratios Vr/Vf and Vz/Va
	- Linearises a wider range of impedances
	- Uses less memory (space for more features!)
 2. Refactored measurement routine to measure ratios rather than individual voltages
	- Backwards compatibility for Scan Raw maintained by outputting fixed Vf and Va values with recalculated Vr and Vz
	- Future version may revert to outputting all individual voltages as this is useful for development & debugging
	- Removed averaging as it doesn't seem to help with measurement noise but removal means faster SWR scanning and pcLink scanning
 3. Added power (mV & dBm) display to Sig level mode
 4. Added message to Capacitance display when reactance is zero
 5. Tested with WinPCC-Sark100 V1.0.01_en_DH1KLM to verify backwards compatibility of Scan Raw output
 6. Dizzling offset now 10% of display frequency (was previously 1MHz)

## UI changes
1. Display changes to match changes above

## Ideas for next version
1. Add a VFO mode with variable output level
2. Add calibration routine for power level meter
3. Display a brief message "Dizzling off"/"Dizzling on" when changing between the first two modes.
