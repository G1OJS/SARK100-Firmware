NOTE - it is possible that the issues discussed below are a result of EA4FRB's firmware being used on a device for which it was not designed. The analyser that I have is an 'MR300' which as I understand it is a clone of the original SARK100 device.

   <h1>Issues addressed</h1>
   <h2>Artifacts and Noise in frequency sweeps</h2>
The graph below shows a measurement taken using the V13 firmware via the pcLink Configuration Menu item, using the "raw" command to export bridge voltages from my MR300 analyser.
I converted these voltages to |Z|, VSWR, R and X using well-known formulas. This graph shows two of the features that I wanted to try to improve:
   <ul>
      <li>Both the VSWR and R curves show step changes that are clearly artifacts and not representative of the true test load impedance.</li>
      <li>The measurement is quite 'noisy', particularly at high impedances.</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>High impedance loads and flatness</h2>
To be written.
   <h2>Inductance and Capacitance modes show zero above 10MHz</h2>
Both the inductance and capacitance modes show zero at 10MHz and above, and I wanted to find out if this could be fixed.
