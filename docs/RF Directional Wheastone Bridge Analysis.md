# Converting Bridge Voltages to Load Impedance
Much online material about Wheatstone bridges focusses on the case where the bridge is balanced, or near balanced (Zl ~ 50 ohms in this case). However, in an instrument that uses a bridge with fixed reference resistors to measure unknown impedance values, we need to work out the unknown impedance from measurements on an unbalanced bridge. The diagram below shows a generic case of such a bridge.
