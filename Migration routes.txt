PSD 5.0 - project loads and builds, gives a working hex file (no known problems) 
        - workspace explorer is empty
        - interconnect does display however and view aligns with screenshot in manual

Migrate to 5.4
  - manually, results in hex file that works fine provided EEPROM writes are commented out
	- simple open
 	- open, remove modules, save, exit, load, add modules
  - also, interconnect view is subtly different in colour codes for Port 0

  - so far, moving the EEPROM allocation hasn't fixed this

  - same result using archive from working PD5.0 build

  - ensuring that flashblock.h and .inc are taken from PB5.3 hasn't helped
  - suspect that flashapi.asm arrived as part of the bootloader, so will forever be tied to v5.0?


PD 5.3 - seems stuck at "loading project". Workplace explorer contents never appear.
