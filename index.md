This site hosts the G1OJS firmware for the SARK100 Antenna Analyser (and its clones). 

Click on the menu buttons above to explore the new features, or click on the links to read about the theory and the development of the firmware.

## Applicable Hardware
I developed this update to EA4FRb's V13 SARK100 source code by testing on my "MR300" unit which uses the same firmware. This unit is produced by [LXQQFY.com](http://www.lxqqfy.com/e/product.php?id=MR300). The firmware should work on SARK100 as well as on MR100 and other variants of the SARK100 analyser, but I have no way of testing on these other devices.

## Credits
With thanks to EA4FRB for designing the SARK100 hardware and Firmware and releasing this under the [GPL licence](https://g1ojs.github.io/G1OJS-MR300-SARK100-Firmware/LICENSE). I have released my version of the firmware under [that same licence](https://g1ojs.github.io/G1OJS-MR300-SARK100-Firmware/LICENSE), which is a requirement of that licence itself.
